        <p>The day school began in June 2011 with an objective to support and empower families of children with developmental difficulties. The children and their families receive direct benefit and an improved quality of life. The school uses various established and logically designed training techniques gathered from around the world and try to apply to the Indian context.</p>
        <p>Emphasis is on developing communication, as well as building basic interaction skills, pre-reading and writing skills and concept building which are taught in one-on-one sessions, while group activities are used to develop social skills. Children, who are ready, move on to mainstream classrooms.</p>
        <p>Since 2012, the project has so far directly benefitted more than 5,000 children between the age group of 3-18 years. Conducting four classes a day, we reache out to more than 800 children a year. The parents have also started taking an interest, talking to the teachers about their child’s problems.</p>
        <p>Apart from this, community based educational programmes were organised in seven slum communities with coverage of 524 children. 12 Balwadis reached 393 children (49% boys & 51% girls). 99% children associated with the project continued their formal schooling and did not drop out. 77% children were regular and had attendance of more than 50% with an average attendance of 20 children per class. Additionally, 756 children benefitted from attending computer classes and 726 children from Byculla Municipal School were supported through school partnership programmes. Approximately, 509 children from 1st – 4th standard were given reading lessons with 97% succeeding to reach the project target.</p>
